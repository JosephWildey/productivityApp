# Introduction

This is the meat and potatoes of the program. There's still a lot of work to be done. However if you download the script and run it in 
terminal it will technically work as is. I'm mostly uploading this to github to keep track of intended updates and stuff.

# Todo
- Fix the buttons
- Allow editing of fields
- automatically remove old events
- allow user to save updated schedules

There's more planned, but this is a pretty good roadmap for now.
