# Introduction

This is the meat and potatoes of the program. There's still a lot of work to be done. However if you download the script and run it in 
terminal it will technically work as is. I'm mostly uploading this to github to keep track of intended updates and stuff.

# Todo
- Finish implementation of buttons
- Add, edit, and delete information in fields
- Read information from and write information to file (again)
- allow user to save updated schedules
- automatically delete old information

There's more planned, but this is a pretty good roadmap for now.

# Known Bugs
- Cannot close the application once the popup has been opened. (Working on that)
