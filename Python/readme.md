# Introduction

This is the meat and potatoes of the program. There's still a lot of work to be done. 

# Todo
- Finish implementation of buttons
- Add, edit, and delete information in fields
- Read information from and write information to file (again)
- allow user to save updated schedules
- automatically delete old information

There's more planned, but this is a pretty good roadmap for now.

# Known Bugs
- Cannot close the application once the popup has been opened. (Working on that)
