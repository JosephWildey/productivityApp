# Introduction

This is the meat and potatoes of the program. There's still a lot of work to be done. However once it is finished it will be a full featured GUI that will hopefully help you budget your time. 

# Todo
- Finish implementation of buttons
- Add, edit, and delete information in fields
- Read information from and write information to file (again)
- allow user to save updated schedules
- automatically delete old information

There's more planned, but this is a pretty good roadmap for now.
