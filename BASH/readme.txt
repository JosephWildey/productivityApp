If you wish to install todo.sh, here are the steps.
1) Copy the code from the todo.sh page.
2) Open your favorite editor - nano is fine - and paste. Save file with a ".sh" extension.
3) Use chmod +x script.sh to make it executable

If you manage to skip steps 1 & 2 by just downloading the file that's fine. Step 3 may still be required.

You should be all set and able to execute the script provided terminal is in the same directory as the script. 
Unless I'm forgetting something, which is possible.
