If you're looking for the finalized project please see the other folder.

If you wish to install todo.sh, here are the steps.
1) Copy the code from the todo.sh page.
2) Open your favorite editor - nano is fine - and paste. Save file with a ".sh" extension.
3) Use chmod +x script.sh to make it executable

If you manage to skip steps 1 & 2 by just downloading the file that's fine. Step 3 may still be required. Also,
the use of emacs is not required. Simply change "emacs" to "nano" in the source code if you prefer the easier editor. 
It won't break anything. I shouldn't be forgetting anything else. Lastly, I do not plan on updating this script from here.


If for some reason you stumble upon this and find this helpful or something please give me credit. Thanks!
