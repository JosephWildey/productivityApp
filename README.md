# Joe's Productivity Application
An app I'm building to boost productivity, improve my understandings of GUIs, and Python/GTK. It initially started out as a
BAsH script and is evolving into something a bit more feature rich. It will likely evolve further over the years as pretty much the only app I intend to focus on while finishing my bachelor's at GVSU in Applied Data Analytics. 

That being said, if I come anywhere near my intended vision for the app (don't hold your breath) it should be pretty neat. Not sure if I'll be doing anything new, and it'll be pretty hacked together. However, it should be neat nonetheless. This really is just a project to help me learn though so don't expect an industrial strength application.

# BASH
This is the initial BASH script I wrote for this program. It accesses a file, outputs its contents, and asks if you need to update the file. Upon confirmation it opens up emacs, though you can open it in any editor you choose. Once you are done close the editor and the script terminates. 

This script is available in the BASH folder. See that folder for the readme.

# Python
The planned GUI version of the current file and script form of this idea. It will feature a list widget and buttons. Eventually it will allow updates in the widget, read from a file, and write to the file. All from a pretty GUI instead of editors and terminal. It will also work on any platform provided GTK is installed.

This entire package will be found in its own directory. It will become much larger than a single file in hindsight.

This portion was created with help from: https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ (I don't know anything about GTK, esp. the Python wrapper)
