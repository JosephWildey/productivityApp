# productivityApp
An app I'm building to boost productivity, improve my understandings of GUIs, and Python/GTK. It initially started out as a
BAsH script and is evolving into something a bit more feature rich. It will likely evolve further over the years as pretty much the only app I intend to focus on while finishing my bachelor's at GVSU in Applied Data Analytics.
