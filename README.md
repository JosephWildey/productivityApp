# Joe's Productivity Application
An app I'm building to boost productivity, improve my understandings of GUIs, and Python/GTK. It initially started out as a
BAsH script and is evolving into something a bit more feature rich. It will likely evolve further over the years as pretty much the only app I intend to focus on while finishing my bachelor's at GVSU in Applied Data Analytics. 

That being said, if I come anywhere near my intended vision for the app (don't hold your breath) it should be pretty neat. Not sure if I'll be doing anything new, and it'll be pretty hacked together. However, it should be neat nonetheless. This really is just a project to help me learn though so don't expect an industrial strength application.

# BASH
This is the initial BASH script I wrote for this program. It accesses a file, outputs its contents, and asks if you need to update the file. Upon confirmation it opens up emacs, though you can open it in any editor you choose. Once you are done close the editor and the script terminates. 

This script is available in the BASH folder. See that folder for the readme.

# Python
This is the OS agnostic desktop application version. It will read and store information in CSV files. It allow updating, editing, and removing information. I designed the GUI w/ Glade and wrote the code. See the Python file for a current roadmap. More ideas will be implemented with time.
