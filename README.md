# productivityApp
An app I'm building to boost productivity, improve my understandings of GUIs, and Python/GTK. It initially started out as a
BAsH script and is evolving into something a bit more feature rich. It will likely evolve further over the years as pretty much the only app I intend to focus on while finishing my bachelor's at GVSU in Applied Data Analytics.

# todo.sh
This is the initial BASH script I wrote for this program. It accesses a file, outputs its contents, and asks if you need to update the file. Upon confirmation it opens up emacs, though you can open it in any editor you choose. Once you are done close the editor and the script terminates.
